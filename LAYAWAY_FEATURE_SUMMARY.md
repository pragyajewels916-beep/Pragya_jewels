# Layaway / Advance Booking Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Layaway / Advance Booking feature for the Pragya Jewels billing application. The feature allows customers to make advance bookings for jewelry items with partial payments and future collection dates.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added new columns to the `bills` table:
  - `advance_payment_date` (DATE): Date when advance payment was made
  - `item_taken_date` (DATE): Date when item was taken for layaway
  - `final_payment_date` (DATE): Date when final payment was made
  - `advance_amount` (NUMERIC): Advance amount paid for layaway
  - `remaining_amount` (NUMERIC): Remaining amount to be paid
  - `tracking_flag` (BOOLEAN): True if final payment date is >= 3 days after advance payment date

### 2. Backend Updates
- Updated the `Bill` interface in `lib/db/queries.ts` to include layaway fields
- Modified `createBill` and `updateBill` functions to handle layaway data
- Created database migration script to add layaway fields to existing bills

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Created a new `LayawayForm` component for capturing layaway details
- Integrated layaway form into the sales billing page
- Added automatic calculation of remaining amount
- Implemented 3-day rule tracking (highlighting transactions where tracking_flag = true)
- Updated invoice printing to include layaway information

### 4. Business Logic
- Automatic calculation of remaining amount (total - advanceAmount)
- Automatic setting of tracking flag based on the 3-day rule
- Storage of all layaway data in the database
- Display of layaway information in transaction history
- Generation of invoice PDF with layaway section

## Implementation Details

### Layaway Form Component
The `LayawayForm` component includes:
- Date pickers for advance payment date, item taken date, and final payment date
- Input fields for advance amount and total amount
- Automatic calculation of remaining amount
- Visual indicator for tracking status based on the 3-day rule
- Validation to ensure all required fields are filled

### Business Logic Implementation
1. **Remaining Amount Calculation**: Automatically calculated as `totalAmount - advanceAmount`
2. **Tracking Flag Logic**: Set to `true` if `finalPaymentDate >= 3 days after advancePaymentDate`
3. **Data Validation**: 
   - Advance amount must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to total amount
   - All date fields must be filled
   - Final payment date must be after or equal to advance payment date

### Database Integration
- All layaway fields are stored in the `bills` table
- Fields are nullable to maintain backward compatibility with existing non-layaway transactions
- Indexes added for performance on date fields

### Invoice Generation
The invoice PDF now includes a dedicated section for layaway information:
- Advance payment date
- Item taken date
- Final payment date
- Advance amount
- Remaining amount
- Tracking status
- Summary text: "Gold taken on {itemTakenDate}, advance of {advanceAmount} paid. Balance settled on {finalPaymentDate}."

## Usage Instructions
