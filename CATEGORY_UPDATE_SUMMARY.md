# Jewelry Category System Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement a complete and standardized list of jewelry categories in the Pragya Jewels billing application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Created a new `categories` table with the following structure:
  - `id`: Serial primary key
  - `name`: Unique identifier for the category
  - `display_name`: Human-readable name for UI display
  - `synonyms`: Array of synonym terms for search functionality
  - `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps

- Added the following jewelry categories as requested:
  - Rings
  - Tops / Kammal (with synonyms: tops, kammal)
  - Chain
  - Bracelets
  - Bangle
  - Necklace
  - Har
  - Dollar (Pendant) (with synonyms: dollar, pendant)
  - Mang Tikka
  - Bay Ring
  - Tali
  - Others

- Modified the `items` table to include:
  - `category_id`: Foreign key reference to categories table
  - `category_name`: Cached display name for performance

### 2. Backend/API Updates
- Enhanced the `Item` interface in `lib/db/queries.ts` to include new category fields
- Added new category-related query functions:
  - `getCategories()`: Retrieve all categories
  - `searchCategories(term)`: Search categories by name or synonyms
  - `getCategoryByName(name)`: Get a specific category by name
- Updated `createItem()` and `updateItem()` functions to automatically look up category IDs when only category names are provided
- Maintained backward compatibility by preserving the existing `category` field

### 3. Frontend/UI Updates
- Modified the Inventory component to load categories dynamically from the database
- Replaced hardcoded category options with dynamic loading
- Implemented synonym-based search functionality in the category dropdown
- Added proper TypeScript typing for the new Category interface

### 4. Migration Support
- Created a migration script (`scripts/migrate-categories.js`) to update existing items with the new category structure
- The migration preserves all existing data while enhancing the category system

## Backward Compatibility
All existing invoices and items remain valid because:
- The original `category` field is preserved in the database
- New fields are additive and don't replace existing data
- The API functions handle both old and new category formats
- All existing UI components continue to work without modification

## Search Synonym Support
The system now supports searching for categories using synonyms:
- "Tops" and "Kammal" both map to "Tops / Kammal"
- "Dollar" and "Pendant" both map to "Dollar (Pendant)"

## Implementation Notes
1. The category dropdown in the inventory management section now loads options dynamically from the database
2. New items automatically get both category_id and category_name populated
3. Existing items can be migrated using the provided script
4. All CRUD operations now use the enhanced category system

## Files Modified
- `lib/db/queries.ts`: Updated interfaces and query functions
- `components/inventory/inventory.tsx`: Updated UI to load categories dynamically
- `database_sql/categories_table.sql`: New database schema
- `scripts/migrate-categories.js`: Migration script for existing data

## Deployment Instructions
1. Run the SQL script to create the categories table and update the items table
2. Deploy the updated frontend and backend code
3. Run the migration script to update existing items with new category references
4. Verify that all existing functionality continues to work as expected
